# Welcome to My First Blog Post

This is the content of my first blog post. I can write in **Markdown** and even include custom components!

<ChartBlock data={{ type: 'bar', values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] }} />

Isn't that cool? I can also include other types of visualizations:

<VisualizationBlock data={{ type: 'network', nodes: 5, edges: 7 }} />

Stay tuned for more exciting content!
