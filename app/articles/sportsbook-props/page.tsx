              The following report was submitted as a Jupyter notebook to OddsJam&apos;s 2024 quant challenge. Given a dataset of player prop bets, the challenge was to evaluate which sportsbook in the dataset is the sharpest.

              In this report I analyze a dataset of 12,624 different NFL player prop bets from four major sportsbooks 
              (DraftKings, ESPN BET, BetMGM, and Pinnacle), evaluate two different methods of adjusting implied 
              probability to true probability (Power vs Multiplicative), and lastly identify which sportbook in the 
              dataset is the sharpest.
            </p>
            <p>
              My findings show that of the four major sportsbooks in the dataset, Pinnacle is the sharpest. 
              My findings also reveal that the favorite-longshot bias is considered when sportsbooks distribute 
              vigorish, and therefore accounting for this yields better true probability estimates.

            <p>
              Next, the implied probabilities are adjusted to be true probabilities by removing the vigorish, or &quot;vig&quot;. 
              Several adjustment methods have been developed to accomplish this, with the most popular being the 
              multiplicative (normalization) method. This is what is employed in the OddsJam No-Vig Fair Odds Calculator.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Distance to Desired Outcome</h3>
            <p>
              Given the small differences in Brier Scores, I developed a new metric to gain more definitive insights. 
              This metric, called &ldquo;distance to desired outcome&rdquo;, is calculated as:
            </p>
            <MathFormula 
              formula="\text{Over Bets: Distance} = Outcome - Desired"
              description="For over bets, positive distance means the outcome exceeded the line"
              block={true}
            />
            <MathFormula 
              formula="\text{Under Bets: Distance} = Desired - Outcome"
              description="For under bets, formula is inverted to maintain consistent interpretation"
              block={true}
            />
            
            <p>
              This metric provides a normalized measure that can be compared across different types of bets. The distance 
              is then correlated with each sportsbook&#39;s probability estimates to evaluate accuracy.

            <p>
              This analysis not only confirms Pinnacle as the sharpest among the four sportsbooks but also strongly 
              indicates the presence of the favorite-longshot bias within our data, suggesting sportsbooks take this 
              into account. The power method emerges as potentially superior to the industry-standard multiplicative 
              method for adjusting odds.
            </p>
            <p>
              The comparative analysis, underscored by both Brier scores and correlation coefficients, reveals the 
              power method&rsquo;s superior performance. Every value in the Power method analysis exceeds its counterpart 
              in the multiplicative approach, highlighting its effectiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Further research into this finding is warranted, especially considering that even a minor advantage in 
              accuracy could significantly impact the profitability of Positive EV betting strategies, given that 
              No-Vig Fair Odds calculations form the foundation of the EV formula.
            </p>
            <p>
              The results show that Pinnacle leads with an accuracy score of 82.34%, followed by ESPN BET at 81.02%. 
              This aligns with Pinnacle&apos;s reputation for having the sharpest lines in the industry. Notably, 
              Pinnacle also maintains the lowest average vig at 4.23%, suggesting they can maintain accuracy while 
              offering better odds to bettors.
